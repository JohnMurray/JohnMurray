### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal project ~graveyard~ playground. None of these projects should be taken seriously, being either things that likely only have value to me or are silly projects for my own learning and entertainment.

I also do a small amount of open-source work for my employer under [@murray-stripe](https://github.com/murray-stripe/).
